# SAR in simple terms
Recently, I wanted to learn more about Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology, and found it very vague and mysterious, despite it being invented in 1951!! So this is my attempt to gather information and summarize in simple plain language and terminology. 

**Definition:**

SAR stands for Synthetic Aperture Radar. This means:
- Synthetic: artifical, not real or genuine.
- Aperture: this part of "SAR" confused me, as the definition of aperture is an opening, such as a hole or gap. Aperture is commonly used in photography, describing the width of the hole in which light passes through. In the context of SAR, the aperture is the size of the antenna that recieves the signal, and, the reason it is "synthetic" is because it uses the movement of the antenna, in most cases the movement along an orbit, to artifically increase the size of the aperture. i.e. it is "faking" the aperture size by moving in a certain direction.
- Radar: stands for Radio Detection and Ranging; a device for determining the presence and location of an object by measuring the time for the echo of a radio wave to return from it and the direction from which it returns.

- so SAR actually has an acronynm nested in the acronym. the long form is: Synthetic Aperture Radio Detection and Ranging.

**Applications:**
- SAR can be used for a miltary or government, SAR is useful for spying on other countries, for example identifying vehicles, ships and troop movement from another country, it could be an adversary or an ally. 
- SAR is useful for understanding the conditions after a major natural disaster such as a hurricane, tornado, flood or earthquake.
- SAR can be used to measure the geometry of the Earth, much like you would measure the size of furniture. 
- SAR can detect changes to the Earth's suface caused by water erosion, excavation, landslide, or even if a vehicle has driven across a homogenous surface like a field or desert.
- Areas with a risk of landslide (metro/underground construction in a city)
- Infrastructures construction sites (freeways, bridges etc.)
- Monitor the integrity of costly infrastructures in the oil, gas and mining industries
- Disaster preparedness or response: volcanoes could also be monitored to to try to model risk of eruptions. After an earthquake, you could measure the displacement of the surface for example.
